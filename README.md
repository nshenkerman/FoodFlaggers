## Overview

We developed FoodFlagger, a web application that addresses Dukeâ€™s campus-wide food point scarcity and helps satisfy the innate human love for free stuff. To do so, our application stores data on several on-campus events with food and alerts and displays these events to users based on a range of their user preferences. Our web application features one main, searchable event feed that is specific to the logged-in user. A guest user can view/search through all events but cannot set preferences. In terms of interaction, a user can update their preferences, like or report events, interact with notifications, and view the running leaderboard (which tracks which user has gotten the most likes)

## Features
